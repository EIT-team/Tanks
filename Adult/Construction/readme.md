# Constructing Adult tank

- [Electrode_Positioning](./Electrode_Positioning/) This had CAD models to position the electrodes based on the EEG 10-20 locations. This model is then subtracted from the tank volume to make the holes to insert the electrodes
- [Printing](./Printing/) __this has the stl files__ Model had to be realigned to make it easier to print flat
- [Skull](./Skull/) has CAD models to create the Skull model from the original conversion from segmentation. Here is where the cylinders generated by the stuff in the [Meshing](../Meshing/) folder is used to create the holes in the skull
- [Tank](./Tank/) CAD models to create the tank from the scalp geometry, originally converted from segmentation. Here is where the electrodes positioned in [Electrode_Positioning](./Electrode_Positioning/) are subtracted to make the holes
