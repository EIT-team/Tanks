# Meshing neonatal tank

## Generate Cylinders
To make the holes in the skull we need to make loads of cylinders aligned to the surface of the skull. You can load the mesh using `Get_Approx_Mesh_For_Holes`. Using this mesh (or the one included), you can make this macro by running `Create_Cylinder_Macro_For_Holes`. Run the `.FCMacro` file in [FREECAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)

## Generate Mesh for EIT
Run `Get_Mesh_From_Comsol`
